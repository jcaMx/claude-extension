# Claude Assistant Chrome Extension

This Chrome Extension integrates with Claude.ai by providing a **sidebar interface** to ask questions directly through Claude's UI. If the Claude tab is not already open, the extension will automatically open Claude.ai in a new tab.

## Features

- **Sidebar Integration**: A persistent sidebar that allows users to interact with Claude.ai directly from the extension.
- **Automatic Claude Tab Opening**: If Claude.ai is not open, the extension will automatically open a new tab with `https://claude.ai`.
- **Message Sending**: Send queries to Claude.ai directly from the sidebar.
- **Textarea Clearing**: Clears the text input area after sending the question.
- **Automatic Focus on Input**: Focuses on Claudeâ€™s text input area and simulates entering text.
- **Error Handling**: Displays relevant error messages if the Claude input editor or send button is not found.
